    <p><strong>Our vision </strong> is a world where every child with cancer has equal access to treatment and care. </p>

    <p><strong>Our mission</strong> is to improve diagnosis, treatment and support for children with cancer, and their families, in low and middle-income countries around the world. </p>
    
    <h2> 
      <id="headline"> Most childhood cancers are curable </id="headline"> </h2>
    <p> We know this because survival rates in the UK, USA and Europe regularly top 80%. But for children in low and middle-income countries, the prognosis is bleak. With their chance of survival falling as low as 10%, over 1,000 young lives are lost to cancer every single day.
